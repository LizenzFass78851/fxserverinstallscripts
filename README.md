# FXserver Install Scripts

- the scripts folder contains the installation scripts for fivem, redm, phpmyadmin 
------
- this branch contains adjustments to the fivem txadmin installation script and an adjusted backup-fivem.sh script (if install-backup-solution.sh) is run because the installation method has been changed to be multi-user friendly. So if you have several helpers on a server who want to upload things to the txData via scp, it is also possible with separate user profiles.
- the directory of txdata can be found under "/" instead of in "/root" folder
a collection of scripts to install the fx server + additional extensions in the form of install scripts
