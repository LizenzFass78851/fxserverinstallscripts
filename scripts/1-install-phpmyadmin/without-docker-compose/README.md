## Install phpMyAdmin Without Docker Compose on Ubuntu Server
A script that installs phpMyAdmin and the essentials around it (tested on Ubuntu 24.04).

**It is possible that the script may lose its effect on older and/or newer Ubuntu versions or when updating the packages installed with the script, and thus the installation of MariaDB, among others, is not configured correctly.**

### Alternatively, see the following guide:
