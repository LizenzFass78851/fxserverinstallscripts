## install-phpmyadmin_without_docker-compose_on_ubuntu-server
- a script that installs phpmyadmin and the essentials around it. (tested on Ubuntu 24.04)
**it is possible that the script may lose its effect on older and/or newer Ubuntu versions or when updating the packages installed with the script, and thus the installation of mariadb, among others, is not configured correctly**

### alternatively, see the following guide
